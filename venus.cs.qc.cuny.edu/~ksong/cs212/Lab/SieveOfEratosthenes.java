*   <b>Description:</b><br>
*   Displays prime numbers using The Sieve of Eratosthenes.
*   </p>
*   <p>
*   The user is permitted to enter a value for n, and then all prime numbers
*   in the range 2 to n are displayed.
*   </p>
*   <p><b>Algorithm:</b></p>
*   <p>
*   We start  with a table of numbers  (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., n) and progressively
*   cross off numbers in the table until the only numbers left are primes.</p>
*   <p> Specifically, we  begin with the first number, p, in the table , and<br>
*   1.   Declare p to be prime, then display it<br>
*   2.   Cross off all the multiples of that number in the table, starting from  p^2 <br> 
*   3.   Find  the  next  number in  the table after p that  is  not yet crossed off and
*   set  p to that number; and then  repeat steps 1 to 3.
